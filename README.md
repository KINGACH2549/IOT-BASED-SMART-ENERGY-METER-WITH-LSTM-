# IOT-BASED-SMART-ENERGY-METER-WITH-LSTM-
A smart Energy Meter that predicts future energy consumption in a house hold using long short term memory network
lectricity plays a significant role in day 
to-day life. The Electrical energy consumption in India 
is the third biggest with 1.176 trillion kWh of electricity 
annually based on 2017 data. The countryâ€™s electricity 
consumption is expected to increase to 4 trillion by 
2030. Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the fastest 
emerging fields and these IoT-based devices have 
revolutionized the electronics industry, The most 
primary objective of this project is to monitor the 
energy consumption of domestic electrical appliances 
and create the awareness about efficient use of 
appliances to conserve energy. Basically, we will be 
designing a system which alerts us when the energy 
consumption exceeds the specified threshold from 
which we will be constantly updating ourselves about 
the power consumption also reduces human 
dependency to collect the reading and minimize the 
technical difficulties regarding the billing process. An 
another important prospect of this smart energy meter 
is that energy consumption can be shown in the 
corresponding rupees or power units set by the user. 
This project is implemented using Arduino, 
NODEMCU, ZMPT101B voltage sensor and a 
ACS712 current sensor module to measure the energy 
consumption. Using this measured data available we 
will make use of the long term short memory (LSTM) 
Model to predict the future electricity usage and 
visualize the data in Thingspeak IoT Platform in the 
form of a dashboard
